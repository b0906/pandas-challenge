# pandas-challenge


Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I create a report that includes the following data. 

## District Summary
Create a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame, of the district's key metrics, including the following:

1. Total schools
2. Total students
3. Total budget
4. Average math score
5. Average reading score
6. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
7. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
8. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


## School Summary
Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

1. School name
2. School type
3. Total students
4. Total school budget
5. Per student budget
6. Average math score
7. Average reading score
8. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
10. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

1. School name
2. School type
3. Total students
4. Total school budget
5. Per student budget
6. Average math score
7. Average reading score
8. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
10. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

1. School name
2. School type
3. Total students
4. Total school budget
5. Per student budget
6. Average math score
7. Average reading score
8. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
10 % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


## Math Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). I create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


## Scores by School Size
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

## Scores by School Type
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (district or charter).
